## `marktplaats-cli`

Client library for making programmatic requests to [Marktplaats.nl](https://www.marktplaats.nl/).

Note: this is a very simple and limited script that uses screen scraping, not the [public API](https://api.marktplaats.nl/docs/v1/index.html). It's meant only for a small project that doesn't need more than the basics. Perhaps this will be changed someday.
